## Design & Architecture

This application utilzes Vuex as the application store for the cards from the API. On initial load of the server the application will fetch all the cards, this makes it quicker to then filter the cards based on the user's choices on the client.

We also have componentized some of the isolated parts of the application like the Form and Card. This enables reusability and eases testing.

We chose to use Nuxt for the framework because it was a quick and easy way to take advantage of the best practices and common patterns in VueJS. It also had server side rendering support out of the box without the hassle of setting it up manually.

This application is written in Typescript to give some confidence around the stability and type safety around the code. This can eliminate the need to do a traditional category of unit testing in Javascript around type checking.

## Deployment

Can be deployed to any static site deployment tool (ex: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) )
